# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast arrays and hashes in Ruby. Include at least two differences and two similarities.

Your answer: Arrays are stored in a specific order based on their index which starts at zero. Hashes are unordered which means the order they were added to a has is not guarenteed.

Researched answer: You also access elements in an array by their position, and you access elements in a has by their keys.

2. What does it mean to implement a TTD workflow?

Your answer: Implementing a TTD workflow means you are going to write a test and run it and get a "good fail". Then you will write a code that makes the code pass.

Researched answer: TDD is a software development approach in which developers write tests for a piece of code before they actually implement the code itself. The TDD workflow typically involves writing a test, running the test and getting a fail, writing the code, run the test again and get a pass, and refactor if needed.

3. Why would super be used in a Ruby class?

Your answer: The super would be used to invoke a method in the superclass of the current class. You would use this to call a method with the same names as the one in the current class but in the parent class.

Researched answer: The primary reasons to use super is Method overriding meaning when the subclass gets a method from the parent class it can choose to override the behavior of that method

3. Active Record: Active Record is a design pattern commonly used in software development, particularly in object-oriented programming, to simplify the interaction with databases.
